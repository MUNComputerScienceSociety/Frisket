# Frisket

Frisket is the [MUN CS Society](http://muncompsci.ca)'s IRC Bot. You can find it on `irc.synirc.net` in `#muncssociety`

Frisket is based upon [Willie](http://willie.dftba.net/), an IRC bot framework.

This repository contains extra modules we've written for our bot. To use these modules, clone this repository, then add the full path of the 'modules' directory to the Willie configuration file under the entry 'extra'.

E.g. `extra = /home/you/Frisket/modules`
